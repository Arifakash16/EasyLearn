A primary-level, High School-level, and College-level students watch the video lecture according to their class and subject. I use YouTube videos as a class lecture on a particular subject. In the admission and Job section, I use the PDF book as a resource and only the job section has an exam test.  Job seekers read the pdf books and test their skills on the exam test and know his/her mark.
